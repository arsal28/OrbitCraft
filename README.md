# OrbitCraft
OrbitCraft is an easy-to-use application designed for students learning to create Orbital Diagrams. Made using Processing and Java, OrbitCraft teaches students how to properly craft Orbital Diagrams for any element up to Radon on the Periodic Table of Elements. This application was made for my Grade 12 Chemistry culminating project (shoutout to Ms. Moledina)!

**PLEASE NOTE:** As of September 09, 2025, this application is deprecated.

## Installation

To create an Orbital Diagram, simply drag and drop the tools provided in the toolbox. Upon completing the Orbital Diagram, press the green "Check" button to check whether the intended element has been created through the Orbital Diagram. To clear the drawing, press the black "Clear" button to erase all objects.
